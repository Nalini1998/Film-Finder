# Film Finder

We’ve caught up on our list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but we aren't sure where to look. 

<br>

In this project, we’ll use our knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a Movie Discovery App that will recommend Random Movies by genre. We’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.
